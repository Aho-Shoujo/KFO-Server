CaseyMayCazy#5850's idea for area locking/unlocking:
Area tags. Example being, you can tag areas and anyone inside the area when said tag changed can only move to areas with the same tag. Example:
[?] = tag name
@ = player

@ [W]Hallway -> [W]Bedroom -> [W]Bathroom

Player can move to bedroom from hallway and to bathroom from bedroom without issue.

[W]Hallway ->[R] @ Bedroom -> [R]Bathroom

Player can only move between Bedroom and Bathroom, not the hallway.

[W]Hallway ->[R] Bedroom -> [B] @ Bathroom

Player can only stay in the bathroom. He can't move to bedroom nor hallway.

This represents the fact that you can lock your bedroom and additionally lock yourself in the bathroom.

A famous man's wise words:
I think eating exotic high-end seafood is very cathartic and inhumane
lobsters, crabs and most other sorts of foods you get beyond fish are made fresh
you take them out the bucket with cuffs on their claws and stab them in the brain then boil their body so they stay fresh
it just feels like taking them out of their habitat and leaving them alive only to kill them immediately after releasing them is harsh
dunno
like with animals it just doesnt feel as bad to kill a pig or rooster that was raised to be turned into food
but when you fish a lobster out of the water than drag it back to a kitchen and cram a blade down its skin and throw it in a cauldron
that just feels ew
