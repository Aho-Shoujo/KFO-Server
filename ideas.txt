CaseyMayCazy#5850's idea for area locking/unlocking:
Area tags. Example being, you can tag areas and anyone inside the area when said tag changed can only move to areas with the same tag. Example:
[?] = tag name
@ = player

@ [W]Hallway -> [W]Bedroom -> [W]Bathroom

Player can move to bedroom from hallway and to bathroom from bedroom without issue.

[W]Hallway ->[R] @ Bedroom -> [R]Bathroom

Player can only move between Bedroom and Bathroom, not the hallway.

[W]Hallway ->[R] Bedroom -> [B] @ Bathroom

Player can only stay in the bathroom. He can't move to bedroom nor hallway.

This represents the fact that you can lock your bedroom and additionally lock yourself in the bathroom.
